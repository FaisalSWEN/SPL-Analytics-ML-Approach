    "**Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier\n",

    "**Classification Report Analysis:**\n",
    "The model achieved an **overall accuracy of 50%**. On a 3-class problem (Home Win, Draw, Away Win), a random guess would be 33%, so 50% shows that the model is learning a real pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"Home Win\" (f1-score: 0.60):** The model is best at predicting a Home Win.\n",
    "* **\"Away Win\" (f1-score: 0.51):** The model is decent at predicting an Away Win.\n",
    "* **\"Draw\" (f1-score: 0.27):** The model struggles the most with predicting a Draw. This is likely because \"Draw\" is the least common outcome (the minority class) in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Finding:**\n",
    "The model's performance is limited by the features we could use. As we discovered in Phase 1, highly predictive features like `stadium`, `city`, and `attendance` were unusable because 85-95% of their data was missing. The model is doing the best it can with only the team names and the season year."
