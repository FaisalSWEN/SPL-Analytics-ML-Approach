      "The stage is set for a seismic encounter in the Saudi Professional League as the iconic Al-Nassr welcomes their eternal rivals, Al-Hilal, to a pulsating Al-Awwal Park. In a clash of titans that promises fireworks, the analysis points towards a decisive **home victory for Al-Nassr**. The energy, the tactics, and the sheer force of individual brilliance are all aligning to create a perfect storm in favor of the Yellow and Blue.\n",

      "\n",
      "Al-Nassr's path to victory is built upon a foundation of overwhelming offensive power and relentless momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Cristiano Ronaldo Catalyst:** At the heart of Al-Nassr's dominance is a figure who needs no introduction. Cristiano Ronaldo is not just a player; he is an institution of winning. His predatory instincts in the box, combined with his aerial dominance and clinical finishing, provide a constant and palpable threat that any defense fears. His leadership elevates the entire squad, turning moments of pressure into moments of opportunity.\n",
      "*   **A Symphony of Attacking Talent:** While Ronaldo is the conductor, the orchestra is world-class. The likes of Anderson Talisca, Sadio Mané, and Otávio create a multi-faceted attacking unit that is incredibly difficult to contain. They possess the pace to exploit spaces behind defensive lines, the creativity to unlock a low block, and the individual flair to produce moments of magic from nothing. This diversity of threat means Al-Hilal cannot focus on neutralizing just one player.\n",
      "*   **Fortress Al-Awwal Park:** The 12th man is a very real factor in this derby. The unwavering support of the Al-Nassr faithful generates an electric atmosphere that intimidates opponents and fuels the home side with an almost tangible energy. Playing in front of their fans transforms the team, giving them an extra yard of pace and a fiercer competitive edge.\n",

    "**Objective:**\n",
    "To determine the best way to present match predictions to users, we tested two different prompt templates using the DeepSeek LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Template 1: Simple / Direct**\n",
    "* **Goal:** Provide a quick, bite-sized reason for the prediction.\n",
    "* **Result:** The model successfully generated a single, impactful sentence focusing on a key player (Cristiano Ronaldo).\n",
    "* **Pros:** Fast to read, good for mobile notifications or quick summaries.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Lacks depth and context; doesn't explain the \"why\" in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Template 2: Expert Analyst**\n",
    "* **Goal:** Provide a deep, professional match preview.\n",
    "* **Result:** The model generated a high-quality article titled \"The Kings' Clash,\" with structured sections on \"Deconstructing Strengths\" and \"The Tactical Battleground.\" It adopted an exciting, professional tone suitable for a sports news site.\n",
    "* **Pros:** Highly engaging, provides valuable context, and makes the application feel like a premium analysis tool.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Requires more reading time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion & Selection:**\n",
    "For our Advice System, we select **Template 2 (Expert Analyst)** as the final choice. [cite_start]Our goal is to provide \"detailed advice or explanations\"[cite: 87], and the Expert template fulfills this much better than the simple one. It transforms a simple data point (\"Home Win\") into a comprehensive narrative that offers real value to the user."
